This repository has Spark notebooks (.dbc).
The code can be seen by importing the notebook. 
Simplest way of doing that is to use community edition of Spark offered by Databricks.
Description of projects: 
1. Predict_Salary.dbc:
  -> In this project, I performed various operations such as data extraction, data cleaning, data transformation, data visualization on Adult dataset. I used Random Forest algorithm to predict whether the salary of a person will be greater than 50K or less than 50K on the basis of a host of parameters such as the workclass, education, occupation, marital_status, sex, race.
2. Poker_Hand_Dataset.dbc
  -> This dataset consists of 10 predictor variables for 2 each for 5 cards of a Poker hand. Out of the two, one is for the suit while other is for the rank of the card. On the basis of the predictors, we decide whether the hand is good or not by using Random Forest algorithm.
